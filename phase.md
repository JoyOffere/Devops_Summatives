Reflection

The IaC process with Terraform was challenging due to initial setup complexities, such as configuring AWS credentials and understanding resource dependencies. Manual deployment required careful coordination between Docker image builds, ECR pushes, and ECS configuration, with a key lesson being the importance of environment variable consistency. Overall, this phase deepened my understanding of cloud infrastructure and container management.
